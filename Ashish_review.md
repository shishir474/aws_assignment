## Task 2

### Create custom role for Lambda Function
- Search IAM in AWS Console.
- Under the Access Management section click on the Roles section.
- Click on Create Role and select AWS Service and Lambda.
- Search CloudWatchLogsFullAccess under the policies section and select it.
- Add your role name and click on create role.

### Lambda Function
- Open the AWS Lambda console and create a new Lambda function.
- Set the runtime to Python 3.x and choose a role with write access to S3.
- Copy and paste the code into the inline code editor.
- Save the function.
- Configure a test event with any event data to test the function.
- Code Explanation
  - Import necessary libraries.
  - Define the name of the S3 bucket and current timestamp as variables.
  - Create a dictionary object with some data to be written to S3.
  - Create an S3 client object using the Boto3 library.
  - Generate a filename with the current timestamp.
  - Convert the data dictionary to a JSON string.
  - Write the JSON string to an S3 object with the specified filename and bucket name.

## Task 3
- Open the AWS Lambda console and create a new Lambda function.
- Set the runtime to Python 3.x and choose a role with write access to S3.
- Copy and paste the code into the inline code editor.
- Save the function.
- Configure a test event with any event data to test the function.
- Code Explanation
  - The code imports the required modules: boto3 for AWS SDK, json for JSON manipulation, and datetime for timestamp generation.
  - The lambda_handler function is the entry point for the AWS Lambda function.
  - The BUCKET_NAME variable stores the name of the S3 bucket where the JSON file will be stored. Change this to your desired bucket name.
  - The current timestamp is generated using datetime.now() and converted to a string using str(datetime.now()).
  - The event parameter represents the event data passed to the Lambda function. The data variable is created as a copy of the event data.
  - A new key-value pair is added to the data dictionary, where the key is 'timestamp' and the value is the current timestamp.
  - The data dictionary is converted to a JSON string using json.dumps(data) and stored in the json_text variable.
  - An S3 client is created using boto3.client('s3').
  - A file name is generated by concatenating the current timestamp with the '.json' extension.
  - The JSON data is uploaded to the S3 bucket using s3_client.put_object(Body=json_text, Bucket=BUCKET_NAME, Key=file_name).
  - Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the "file_name" key with the value of the generated file name.
